# pneumoniaCNN
This is a project that uses images in order to classify whether a patient has pneumonia. The dataset we're using is open-source hosted by
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia">Kaggle</a>. We want to know whether we can use a popular machine
learning, Convolutional Neural Network, to classify pneumonia.
