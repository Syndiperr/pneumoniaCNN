Convolutional Neural Network

CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.
They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics

They have these layers
    1. Convolution
        - Take small patches of image
        - look for similarities in images
        - 1. Line up the feature and image
        - 2. Mulitply each image pixel by the corresponding
             Feature pixel
        - 3. Add all values, divide by number of pixel
            - Place the value in the center of filter
        - Do this for all the filters
        - Will get an "image" of the Convolution layer output

    2. ReLU Layer - Rectified Linear Unit 
        - Remove every negative value from filtered image and replaces with zeros
        - This is done to avoid summing up to ZERO
        - Activation function x<0 fx=0 , x>=0 fx=x
        - Will take the output for the feature and apply ReLU
          This will be done for all the features
        
    3. Pooling
        - Shirk the image to a smaller size
        - Pick Window size (Usually 2 or 3)
        - Pick a stride (usually 2)
        - Walk your window across filtered image
        - From each window, take max value
        - like 2x2 and take the max and map to smaller array 11:02
        - 
    4. Fully Connected
